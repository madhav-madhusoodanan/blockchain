# Server management
We will need to run an NGINX instance which will supervise every worker servers <br>
Servers could be hosted on 

<ol>
    <li> Heroku
    <li> Netlify
    <li> DigitalOcean
    <li> If possible, Firebase too
</ol>

Critical condition is, all server instances must NOT depend on a credit card
